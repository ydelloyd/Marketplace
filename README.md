# Intuit Mailchimp Fullstack Take Home Assessment - Job Marketplace

Welcome to the Intuit Mailchimp Fullstack Take Home Assessment! This project is a simplified job marketplace where users can post contract jobs and place bids on them. The focus is on core functionalities, allowing you to demonstrate your abilities in both frontend and backend development.

---

## Project Setup

The project contains the following main directories:

- **Frontend (React with NX framework)**: Located in the `/frontend` directory.
- **Backend (TypeScript Express API)**: Located in the `/backend` directory. The backend uses SQLite for storage.

The setup here is for your convenience. If you'd like to reach for different technology, you're welcome to do so.

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have everything downloaded locally. You should set up a new git repository.
1. Have [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

### Running the build

1. Navigate to the root directory.
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`
1. Visit the frontend at `http://localhost:8080/`
1. Visit the backend at `http://localhost:3001/`. `http://localhost:3001/users` demonstrates a working return of data.

- `GET /api/jobs/:id`: Get details of a specific job posting.
- `POST /api/jobs/:id/bids`: Place a new bid on a specific job.

### Frontend

Create a user-friendly interface using React (managed by NX):

- **Home Page**: Displays the 5 most recent and 5 most active job postings with links to job details and posting a new job.
- **New Job Page**: Form to create a new job posting.
- **Job Details Page**: Displays job details and allows placing a new bid.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling on both backend and frontend.
- **Code Quality**: Follow best practices for code quality, including naming conventions and modularity.
- **Documentation**: Include a README file with setup and run instructions.
- **Automated Testing**: Basic unit tests for both frontend and backend.
